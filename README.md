# RQA

v 0.1.1

***

A set Mathematica tools for RQA â€” Recurrence quantification analysis.

Note that I posted an early version of this to GitHub for sharing with the 2019 Wolfram Summer School. It is, as such, incomplete, undocumented, and other fun un-things. I will continue to update and upgrade over the next few weeks as part of the program, but won't have time to do a full push until later.

The package is full of minor compromises that need worked out and refined. I invite any and all enhancements.
