## Time-series related

- Check for `RegularlySampledQ`
- Even better, allow for non time series and allow for re-sampling option.

## Tests

- Embedding tests
- Tau tests

## Measures

- Older measures like CORM?

## Validate

- Finish implementation of the Estimation of Embedding Dimensions. I based this on an older Kennel reference, but there is a new kid in town
